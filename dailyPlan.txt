Day 3 – HTML Skeleton
Create index.html.


Add placeholder sections for each screen (e.g., <div id="welcome">…</div>).


No styling yet — just the structure.;.


Test that you can hide/show sections with simple JS display: none



Past Assignment:

Week 1 – Design & Structure
Day 1 – Concept Lock-In
Finalize your product name (something uplifting + productivity-focused).


Write your one-sentence mission: “A simple planner that organizes tasks into easy, medium, and hard — with gratitude and mindfulness built in.”


Create a list of 10–15 gratitude prompts and 10–15 mindful tips in a Google Doc.

 (These will be your unique “feel-good” touch.)



Day 2 – User Flow Mapping
Open a notebook or whiteboard.


Sketch the four screens: Welcome → Input → Categorization → Output.


Decide which elements are must-have for MVP vs. later upgrades.


Bonus: Think of a 2–3 color theme and font style that feels calming (e.g., light blue + cream + accent green).
